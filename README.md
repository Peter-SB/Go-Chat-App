# Project Overview

This is an **instant messaging chat app** made to practice and expand my full-stack development abilities. It was built with a **Go** backend, a **React** frontend, and a **MySQL** database and all containerized using **Docker Compose** for repeatable and easy deployment.

I've taken time to implement from scratch advanced patterns like **dependency injection** for modularity, scalability, and ease of testing. I also investigated and implemented security measures such as **session management**, **CSRF tokens**, and custom **CORS middleware**. The project is complete with some examples of testing practices such as mock services and unit tests for demonstration of best practices in Go.

# Features

# Motivation

This project was built as a learning exercise while teaching myself **Go** and exploring full-stack development and best practices for web development.

There are lots of good Go web frameworks such a Gin that handle some of the stuff implemented however the aim was to practice and learn the core concepts. After this I will be better equipped to use frameworks in future now I better understand the underlying mechanics.

# Explanation of Technical Concepts

### Websockets:

I first started this project to get more hands on experience with websockets. Initially just for the instant messaging communication. I later expanded this to also communicate active user updates as well.

At the moment Gorilla/websockets is defacto standard library for websockets in Go.

### **Concurrency in Go**:

This program uses concurrency by making use of Go’s Goroutines, channels, and mutex to handle tasks that can run independently and in parallel. Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by Go's runtime, allowing us to execute multiple tasks at the same time. Channels provide a way for Goroutines to communicate safely, ensuring data consistency and avoiding race conditions. Mutexes (mutual exclusions) ensure safe access to shared resources

For example, the `broadcast.StartBroadcastListener()` Goroutine listens on a shared channel to receive messages and broadcasts them to all connected clients A mutex ensures that the shared `clients` map is accessed safely:

```go
// Example Channel for broadcasting messages
var broadcast = make(chan models.Message)

// Example code from broadcast.go
// Goroutine to listen and handle messages
func StartBroadcastListener() {
	broadcast := utils.GetBroadcastChannel()
	clients, mutex := utils.GetClients()

	for msg := range broadcast {
		messageBytes, _ := json.Marshal(msg)
		mutex.Lock() // Lock the mutex to prevent concurrent writes to the clients map

		for client := range clients {
			select {
			case client.Send <- messageBytes: // Send message to each client
			default:
				utils.DeregisterClient(client) // Remove client if unresponsive
			}
		}
		mutex.Unlock() // Unlock the mutex after processing
	}
}

// Example sending a message to the channel
func BroadcastMessage(msg models.Message) {
    broadcast <- msg // Send the message to the broadcast channel
}

// Example starting the go routine
go broadcast.StartBroadcastListener()
```

Here, `StartBroadcastListener` runs as a Goroutine and continuously listens for messages on the `broadcast` channel. When a message is received, it is sent to all connected WebSocket clients via their respective `Send` channels. This allows the program to handle multiple clients and messages simultaneously without blocking other tasks.

### **Session Authentication and CRFT Tokens**:

As part of this I really enjoyed learning more about session and CSRF tokens, and implement them myself from scratch. While JWT and OAuth are more modern standards, session tokens are still widely used. Understanding how this introduces security vulnerabilities and how CSRF tokens stops these vulnerabilities was particularly interesting to learn.

**Explanation:**

The core idea is that a session token is a way of identifying a user for a given period. This token is given to the user as a cookie when they log in and can be used to identify themselves when they make a request (such as connecting to the chat web socket or accessing their profile).

However this can introduce a vulnerability called CSRF (cross site request forgery). Because cookies are automatically sent with requests, a malicious website could redirect an unexpecting user to make a request without the users knowing.

CSRF tokens protect against this by verifying the origin of the request. By sending a user a CSRF token when they login, also as a cookie, cross-origin site policy only allowed authorised pages to access the CSRF token and attach it as a customer header.

CSRF tokens are not needed everywhere though. If you load the website and have previously logged in and already have a session token, you can be automatically connected to the websocket. However, the browser needs to know the username to connect. So the session-check endpoint allows the browser to check the session token validity and get the username. This endpoint however wont bother checking the CSRF token since its a GET endpoint and not performing any actions on behalf of the user. Generally CSRF tokens are only needed for state-changing operations.

**Downsides:**

- highly distributed systems can put a strain on reading session tokens from databases if a database read is needed to check tokens for every action.
- Improper token handling (e.g. storing session tokens wrong) can cause vulnerabilities.

### Dependency Injection:

This project demonstrates Dependency Injection (DI) by using it for both the database and the auth service.

Dependency Injection is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC). (IoC being a design principle where objection creation is separate from the object consuming code.) DI achieves this IoC by receiving dependencies from an external source rather than creating them internally with the objects code. DI helps improve code maintainability, testability, extendable, and flexibility by abstracting dependencies behind an interface.

In Go, rather than traditional inheritance, object orientation is achieved more through interfaces. While Go lacks class-based inheritance, polymorphism is achieved by defining interfaces and implementing their methods in Go structs. For example, we define a `DBInterface` that specifies the required methods. Any struct that implements these methods can be used interchangeably.

The `MySQLDB` struct acts as a wrapper around the actual database connection. Because it adheres to the `DBInterface`, we can swap or mock functionality without having to change the mySQL implementation.

```go
type DBInterface interface {
	SaveMessage(msg models.Message) error
	GetChatHistory() ([]models.Message, error)
	DeleteAllMessages() error
	SaveUser(username, hashedPassword string) error
	GetUserByUsername(username string) (models.User, error)
	UpdateSessionAndCSRF(userID int, sessionToken, csrfToken string) error
	ClearSession(userID int) error
	GetUserBySessionToken(sessionToken string) (models.User, error)
}

type MySQLDB struct {
	db *sql.DB
}
```

**Benefits Of Dependency Injection**:

**Testability**: Using interfaces for DI makes it easy to replace database or auth implementations with mocks during unit testing. The auth unit tests swap out the mySQL database implementation for a MockDB.

**Flexibility**: Abstracting dependencies allows you to use different implementations without changing code. This is particularly useful for integrating new services like a database. By decoupling dependencies, DI reduces tight coupling between components, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.

**Separation of Concerns**: DI promotes clean architecture by separating the logic of object creation from business logic, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

This architecture could be further improved with the **Repository Pattern**. This would mean encapsulating our database functionality further by creating another layer of abstraction, decoupling the data access logic from other business logic. This would make testing and new service integration even easier.

### Middleware Pattern and CORS:

Because my backend was on a different port to my frontend, I had to add Cross-Origin Resource Sharing headers to my requests. To do this I implemented a Middleware pattern to sit between request and application logic to set up headers needed.

### Unit Tests:

Unit tests have been written for the auth service and the mock database, however I chose not to aim for full code coverage because the focus was on learning and demonstrating abilities.

In Go, it is est practice is to name test files `_test.go` and put them in the same directory as the code they are testing. This is to make it easy to find the tests and supposedly encourages writing tests alongside the code. It is suggested to use separate directories for integration tests.

Within test files is is best practice to name test functions `TestXxx` where `Xxx` describes the test.

Also in Go, you can use `t.Run` to group related test cases in subtests.

### **DevOps Skills**:

Utilized Docker Compose for consistent environments and streamlined deployment.

# Further Expansion

- Chat paging and offset
- Repository Pattern: I was investigating other patterns such as using a repository pattern. by doing so I could increased testability of my database code and allow easy integration with out databases. However given the size of the program, and a general less is more mindset in Go, I chose to stop at dependency injection.
- WebSocket Scalability
- Rate Limiting and other security measures
- Implement CI/CD pipelines.
- Refactor - some files have been become a bit bloated and could do with a refactor if further functionality were going to be added.
